# Why is Cryptography Necessary
Many people think that ciphers are a child's plaything. However, this could not be further from the truth. Governments have even had to censor papers and literature that released findings related to decrypting, especially if it was cutting-edge at the time. For centuries, the ability to send secure messages has been requisite for ensuring privacy and secrecy. Ancient generals used ciphers to organize their troops. Researchers have leveraged cryptoanalysis techniques to read languages that we have long been unable to read. Digital information is *everywhere* and messages are constantly being sent over wires and radio frequencies in the modern world. Encryption is a very powerful tool - it's all around us... Are you ready to learn cryptography, one byte at a time?
